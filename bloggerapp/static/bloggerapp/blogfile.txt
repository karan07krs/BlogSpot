One Plus 7T Review
Verdict
The OnePlus 7T is an excellent bit of hardware. The Fluid AMOLED, 90Hz screen is industry leading and a key feature we’d like to see other mobile phone makers adopt. Add to this its improved fast charging, CPU and triple-sensor rear camera and the OnePlus 7T quickly becomes a pretty alluring bit of kit.  The OnePlus 7T has a reworked Fluid AMOLED screen Out of the box you’ll struggle to tell the OnePlus 7T from the regular OnePlus 7. It has the same OnePlus 6T inspired mixed metal and glass design, which is no bad thing. The design may not have the nifty pop-up front camera setup seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro (read our OnePlus 7T Pro review), but it still looks great and comes with a wealth of handy features.  Up front you’ll see a cool Huawei P30-style dew drop notch front camera housing. Under the display there’s also an in-screen fingerprint scanner, which works a treat, though I used the face unlock feature for most of my review. On the side there’s also a nifty quick switch that lets you switch between noise, vibrate and silent profiles on the fly.  The OnePlus 7T is actually a small update to the OnePlus 7 that launched earlier this year. It aims to offer buyers a number of subtle, but important hardware improvements on its predecessor.  Highlights include an upgraded Fluid AMOLED display, more powerful CPU, better fast charging and a new triple-sensor rear camera.

Redmi Note 8 Pro Review
Verdict
The Redmi lineup has been one of the most sought-after budget smartphones for years now, but with competition heating up in the segment, Xioami needs to step up its game to stay relevant. The Redmi Note 8 Pro is an attempt to do that and has a lot to offer for the price delivering new hardware and a set of much-needed features.  Packing the brand new Helio G90T chipset along with a huge 4,500 mAh battery with fast charging and a quad-camera setup on the back, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has all that it takes to be a competitive handset. At first glance, performance is comparable to flagships from last year while the camera setup aims to provide a versatile experience on the cheap.  Moreover, Note 8 Pro is one of the first devices to incorporate the brand new 64MP sensor from Samsung with native pixel-binning technology. We are expecting good low-light performance and competent Night mode to complement the overall camera performance

Conclusion
Skimming through the specs sheet reveals only one drawback so far, and that’s the choice of cameras. In the quad-camera array on the back, a telephoto unit is missing. Instead, you get a dedicated macro lens, and it remains to be seen whether the macro camera makes any difference compared to taking a standard close-up shot with the main camera and then cropping. Those 64MP can be put to work.
